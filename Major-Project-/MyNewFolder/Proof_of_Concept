Proof of Concept & Feasibility Highlights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & OCR Extraction
‚úÖ Concept: Users upload income-related documents, OCR extracts text.
‚úÖ Feasibility: Tesseract OCR, Google Vision API, AWS Textract for structured/unstructured data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing & Validation
‚úÖ Concept: Clean, format, and validate extracted data via APIs (PAN, Aadhaar).
‚úÖ Feasibility: NLP for text cleaning, government APIs for verification, cross-checking figures.

3Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Based Classification & Auto-Fill
‚úÖ Concept: ML models classify income, deductions & auto-fill ITR fields.
‚úÖ Feasibility: Supervised learning for classification, rule-based tax-saving suggestions.

4Ô∏è‚É£ ITR Type Selection (Auto-Suggestion)
‚úÖ Concept: Suggests ITR form (ITR-1 to ITR-4) based on income sources.
‚úÖ Feasibility: Decision tree logic, AI-based recommendations.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Tax Calculation & Optimization
‚úÖ Concept: Computes taxable income, applies deductions, selects the best tax regime.
‚úÖ Feasibility: Rule-based tax calculations, Old vs. New regime comparison.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Filing & E-Verification
‚úÖ Concept: Auto-fills ITR, allows review, submits electronically with e-verification.
