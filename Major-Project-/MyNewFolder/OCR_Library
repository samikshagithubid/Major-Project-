OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Libraries

Tesseract OCR (pytesseract) – Extracts text from scanned images and PDFs.

pdfplumber – Extracts structured text, especially from tabular PDFs.

PyMuPDF (fitz) – Reads and processes PDF documents.

EasyOCR – Deep learning-based OCR for better accuracy on complex documents.

Keras-OCR – Uses deep learning models for text extraction.


2️⃣ NLP (Natural Language Processing) Libraries

spaCy – Used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract names, PAN, Aadhaar, and financial details.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – Tokenization, stemming, and parsing of text data.

TextBlob – Simplifies text processing tasks like sentiment analysis (if required).

transformers (Hugging Face) – Uses pre-trained language models for better text understanding.
