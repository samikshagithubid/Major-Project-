What are the Important Documents Required for Filing ITR?
Income Tax Return (ITR) documents differ according to the tax filer's earning sources. But, certain documents are mandatory for every taxpayer, irrespective of income sources. Here is a list of such common ITR documents that are required to file ITR

PAN Card
This is the first and foremost prerequisite if you are filing an income tax return. PAN is also required to deduct TDS and should be linked with your bank account for direct credit of income tax refund (if any). It is issued by the Income Tax Department, and a salaried employee can find the PAN number either on a PAN card, Form 26AS, Form 16, Form 12BB, etc. However, as per the recent amendment by the Govt, taxpayers can also file the ITR with their Aadhaar number instead of their PAN number.

Aadhaar Card
According to Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, individuals need to provide his/her Aadhaar card details while filing the returns. If you do not have your Aadhaar card but have applied for the same, you must provide the enrolment ID in your IT returns. Linking PAN and Aadhar helps in verifying your income tax return online through an OTP. The income tax return last date every year is 31st July for individuals.
UIDAI issues Aadhar card. In case you have lost it or couldnâ€™t find your Aadhaar card, then you can also download it online.

Form 16
This form consists of the details of the employee's salary and the amount of TDS deducted from the salary. Form 16 consists of two different parts, Part A and Part B. Part-A contains the details of the amount of tax deducted by the employer during the financial year, along with the PAN and TAN details of the employer. The Part B of the form consists of TDS calculations like gross salary breakup, exempt allowances, perquisites, etc.
Please note that Form 16 is issued by the employer. It is a vital document for filing ITR by a salaried individual. If you do not have Form 16, know how to file your ITR without Form 16.

Form-16A/ Form-16B/ Form- 16C
Form-16A is issued for TDS deducted on payments other than salaries, such as income from recurring deposits, fixed deposits, etc. If a person sells his property, then Form-16B is issued. It has details about TDS deducted from the amount paid to the seller. Form 16C is a TDS certificate that reflects the TDS deducted on rent @5% by an individual or HUF under section 194IB.
Form 16A is issued by deductors like banks, contractors, etc. Form 16B, on the other hand, is issued by the buyer. Further, a person deducting TDS on rent is required to furnish Form 16C to the payee within a period of 15 days from the date of furnishing the Challan cum statement in Form 26QC.
The details of TDS can alternatively be fetched from your Form 26AS.

Bank Account details
Disclosures of all active bank accounts are mandatory in the ITR. Bank account details like your bank name, account number, IFSC, and number of accounts you hold must be quoted in the income return. Also, one account shall be selected as primary to assist the Income Tax Department in refunding your tax refund by electronic transfer to such account. Bank details are used to check your income disclosures, high-volume transactions, etc. These details can be easily found in bank passbooks, cheque book, statements, net banking accounts, etc.

a.) TDS deducted by the bank
b.) TDS deducted by the employer
c.) TDS deducted by other organizations from the payments done by you
The individual should ensure that all the taxes deducted in the financial year are reflected against the PAN in Form-26AS. In case of a mismatch, you will not be able to claim the tax credit for the TDS deduction. Therefore, the same should be rectified by getting in touch with the deductor.

AIS shows both reported value and modified value (i.e., the value after considering taxpayer feedback) under each section (i.e., TDS, SFT, and Other information).
Note: A new feature has been added to AIS that will allow the taxpayers to see if their feedback has been addressed by the department, either fully, partially or rejected.
TIS: Taxpayer Information Summary (TIS) is category-wise aggregated information summary for a taxpayer. It shows the processed value (i.e., the value generated after deduplication of information based on pre-defined rules) and derived value (i.e., value derived after considering the taxpayer feedback and processed value) under each information category (e.g., Salary, Interest, Dividend, etc.).
